# PoGoNESTMap
An automated mapping of specific Pokemon Go spawn points and times for NESTS based on data submitted from PGM users.

Sample dataset provided in nestdb.sql.
Sample percentage calculation in nestresume.sql.

Current project:
Provide a user-end that can search a mapping generated from a mySQL database. The DB will contain no more than 1 entry for each spawnpoint per species spawned.


DISCLAIMER: I'm a total noob, this is my first project, and I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing but somehow its coming together. :)

NOTE: Someone gave me the original code for this mapping but unfortunately I don't know who that was! If you know, please provide me their name so I can credit them properly.
